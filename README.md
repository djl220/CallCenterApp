# CallCenterApp
Small call center app to replace some functionality of Cisco's Webex Calling Contact Center.

This will allow our company to log "wrap codes" from our call center in a cloud based SQL database in order to run reports on the types of calls received. This was created to avoid purchasing the Webex Calling Contact Center expansion for this one piece of functionality.

Also took this project as an opportunity to learn some Python
